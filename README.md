All projects I do on my side, for fun, to train myself.
The purpose is purely for learning, do not hesitate to tell me what's wrong !

## MatchGameC

> The mini-game

A cool little project in C to get the hang of the language.
You will be given a set of matches. Each turn, you'll be able to take 1,2 or 3 matches. Next, it will be your opponent's turn to do the same.
Your objective is to not take the last match.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Check that you are in the good fodler (MatchGameC).
3. Run the main.exe file from it.

> Functionalities

1. Play against a real player.
2. Play against a bot.

> Known bugs
